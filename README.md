# CloseYourWindows
A simple script to track when windows should be opened or closed

In Germany, air conditioning is not common - in order to keep your house cool, it is critical to open and shut windows at proper times to allow convective cooling to occur.

This script allows you to set your location, and will monitor Open Weather via API calls to get temperature readings. It will print a message when a window should be open or closed. This can be coupled with an email or SMS notification tool in order to push messages to a remote user.
